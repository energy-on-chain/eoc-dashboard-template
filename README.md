# Welcome to "eoc-dashboard-template"!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]
This repo contains the boiler plate python and web3 code for automatically pulling crytpo data from the web, storing it in the cloud, and displaying it realtime via your web browser. In addition to being interactive, it has great extensibility when it comes to quickly adding new ways to view your unique portfolio or information.

## [ BACKGROUND ]
I started building a crypto portfolio web app to better understand my own holdings while simultaneously increasing my python Dash skills. After friends and colleagues remarked on how useful they found it, I started offering it to others. Feel free to borrow this code if it inspires your own development, or get in touch with me if you'd like some help!

## [ STACK ]
- Python (Dash)
- Google Cloud (Storage, Cloud Functions, App Instance)

## [ LESSONS LEARNED ]
This project was one of the first ones that got my feet wet with using Google Cloud services. In addition to pulling crypto API data on an automated schedule and storing it in the cloud, I also got to play around with deploying the web app as an App Instance. Overall, this increased my skills substantially when it came to integrating applications with cloud services. This current boilder plate code repo reflects the changes that I wanted to make after creating the initial application in order to make the cloud integration more seamless. It will keep getting better as more dashboards get built and more lessons are learned!
